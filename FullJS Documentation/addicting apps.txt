reward system for completing objectives
rewards are variable
crowd approval
investment too great to leave
ownership
stories that keep attention
hiscores
repetition
easy to learn hard to master
dopamine
virtual rewards, virtual equity too
stopping points
use it or lose it
test ourselves without serious consequence
taking care of something
